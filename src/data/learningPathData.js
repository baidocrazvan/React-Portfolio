    description: `An excellent introduction to programming using Python. 
      David Malan's teaching style made complex concepts approachable and engaging.
      The course is mainly focused on problem-solving, algorithms, and the fundamentals
      of computer science,amongst other things like Object-Oriented-Programming and unit
      tests. I would say it's a perfect entry pointfor somebody who doesn't want to delve
      straight into the famously hard(er) CS50x course. Course consists of weekly
      assignments for each of the 9 problem sets that need to be submitted and
      graded. A final final project is needed to pass.`,

The instructor believes in learning by doing, so each lesson takes place in Scrimba's IDE where you need to stop listening and solve challenges in order to progress the course.
